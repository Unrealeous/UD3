## Requirements:
1. The firmware binary files: UD3_QFN.cyacd or UD3_TQFP.cyacd.  The former is for the 68-pin QFN package of the PSoC chip as used in the PSoC development kit.  The latter is for the 100-pin TQFP PSoC chip.  Pre-built firmware binaries can be obtained [here](https://github.com/Netzpfuscher/UD3/releases).

2. Software to flash the firmware.  The software is free from Infineon.  You can use [PSoC Creator](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/sdk/psoc-software/psoc-creator/?utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-product_families) or [PSoC Programmer](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/programming-testing/psoc-programming-solutions/#!downloads).

3. A programmer board similar to the one included in the [CY8CKIT-059](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-059/) development kit.

## Flashing the Firmware
